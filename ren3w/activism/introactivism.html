    <p> So you've learned a little about environmental racism in Saint Louis, now what? To address these inequities, activists have come up with the idea 'environmental justice', which essentially just means that everyone, regardless of where they live, how much money they make, and the color of ther skin, is represented in the fight against climate change - and that the disproportionate effects of climate change that marginalized communities face are addressed, quickly.  </p>
    <h3> An Introduction to Environmental Justice </h3>

<p> Now that you know the basic facts and what the leading activists are teaching, what are you supposed to do to fight environmental racism (and racism in general)? Education is <b>always</b> the first step, so you are headed in the right direction. </p>

<h3> Educate Yourself </h3>
<p> One of the keys to being an activist is to know what you are talking about and to stay up to date on the issues that you are fighting for. You have given yourself a good introduction on environmental racism, in Saint Louis, but it is just an introduction. Continue to educate yourself; we have provided some good resources to do so under the 'resources' tab. Another key to educating yourself is staying up to date on the issues, so find some good news sources and keep up with them. </p>

<h3> Educate Others </h3>
<p> After you have educated yourself, spread that wealth. Knowledge is power, and activism requires growing a movement's power. So get out there (safely, with a mask) and talk about what you learned. Have discussions with others, answer other's questions to the best of your abilities, and encourage them to do their homework as well. </body>

<h3> Use Your Talents! </h3>
<p> Yes, you. You have many talents, grow them and the movement by using them for good. If you are a graphic designer, make infographics summarizing what you have read, and post them! (Social media can be used for social good, as you most likely have seen before.) If you make videos, make some educational ones! If you are a good speaker, talk to people! If you are a coder, make an educational website or app! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹ You get the point! </p>

<h3> Protest </h3>
<p> You are most likely picturing a march, chants in the streets, and creative cardbord signs declaring "GREEN NEW DEAL NOW!" when I say "protest". While you aren't wrong, physical protest can be incredibly productive; physical protest isn't the only way to protest and isn't the only productive way to protest. You can protest by boycotting brands that actively harming black communities and communities of color; in America, money speaks, so by taking capital away from businesses that don't stand for the environment and people of color, you are protesting. If we are all able to protest financially, this will be incredibly effective. However, not all people are in a position to choose to boycott these companies, as the more ethical and sustainable options in the market tend to be more expensive. </p>
<!-- <p> Don't fret if you are unable to financially protest! There are so many other ways to </p> -->
