  <li> black children in stl make roughly 10 times more emergency room visits for asthma each year than white children; black children make more than 42 emergency room visits per 1,000 children, compared to less than 4 visits per 1,000 children for their white counterparts. </li> 
  <li> mold complaints highest in majority black neighborhoods</li>
  <li> most of stl's air pollution sources are located in neighborhoods of color, and more building demolitions – which create harmful dust that may contain asbestos and lead – occur in majority-black neighborhoods </li>
  <li> black households in St. Louis are disproportionately affected by energy burdens (the percentage of income spent on utilities), far exceeding the citywide median </li>

  <p> "the city seems quicker to respond to problems in the central west end than in majority black neighborhoods in north st. louis, and it’s not for lack of political leadership on this.” - reverend rodrick burton </p>
  <br> 
  <p> " the city’s focus on enhancing majority-white areas has left majority-black areas without adequate access to public transit or healthy food, and with high concentrations of vacant properties and illegal trash dumping." - washU resport </p>

## institutional racism in stl 
<p>  mo entered the Union in 1821 as a slave state </p>
<p> old courthouse downtown is known for the dred scott case, in which the us supreme court ruled that descendants of slaves were not “citizens,” had no rights under the constitution, and could not use the courts to sue for their freedom. - washU report </p>
 <p> stl was a major slave auctioning center in the 1850s and “free” blacks needed licenses to live in the city, were banned from voting, and faced housing restrictions, curfews, bans on education, and other discriminatory forces. </p>
<p> historically, stl has been one of the most segregated cities in the <b>country</b>. -washU report </p>
<p> stl has long used its planning and zoning powers not only to enforce racial segregation, but also to confine blacks to areas with greater environmental and health risks, including industrial areas with polluting facilities. - washU resport </p>
<p> “the concentration of blacks in the city and in pockets in the county is accompanied by the confinement of a disproportionate number of them in overcrowded or substandard accommodations." - black jack federal appeals case </p> 
<p> black people in stl 3x more likely than white people to be living in poverty </p> 
<p> the 1987 groundbreaking study, <i>Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States</i>, called out stl as one of six cities with both large black populations and high numbers of uncontrolled toxic waste sites. this history is by no means behind us. </p>

## lead poisoning 
<img src = "images/2017leadposioning.PNG" height = "350px"> 
<p> St. Louis has very high levels of childhood lead poinoning is because 90% of the homes in the City were built before 1980, which was before lead paint was banned in 1978. Lead paint in homes become dust and end up on children's hands, toys, and other objects they might put in their mouths. </p>
<p> However, there is a large disparity between lead poisoning rates in black communities and lead poisoning rates in white communities, as many majority-white wards with high-percentage of pre-1980 homes have very low lead poisoning rates, while majority-black wards with high-percentage of pre-1980 homes have very high lead poisoning rates. </p>
<p> In 2017, Less than 2% of children in majority-white wards had lead poisoning compared to over 10% of children in majority-white wards. </p>
<p> Inadequate building maintenance and other unsafe housing conditions are more likely to be the cause of lead poisoning disparities than building age itself. </p>
<p> High childhood lead poisoning rates are more present in areas where many are living below the poverty level, which are mostly majority-black. </p>
<p> Lead poisoning rates are higher in low-income and minority neighborhoods in inner cities than in white suburban neighborhoods. Part of this is because suburban development and racial segregation after World War II kept minority families  in low-quality urban housing and out of suburban neighborhoods.</p>
<h3> Impacts of lead poisoning: </h3>
<p> can cause permanent brain and nervous system damage, which can make learning more difficult and slow growth and development </p>
<p> can cause learning disabilities, behavioral and emotional problems, and agression that can lead to higher school drop-out rates, suspensions, and criminal activity.</p>
<br>

## asthma 
<img src="images/2012-2014-asthma-hospitalizations.png" height="350px">
<p> Racial disparity for asthma is attributed to poor quality housing, limited access to preventative healthcare, and high mold exposure and air pollution. </p>
< Unsafe housing conditions that can trigger asthma, such as mold, are nearly impossible to detect before signing a lease. </p>
<p> To make matters worse, air pollution and mold disproportionately affect black communities in St. Louis, which is part of the reason those commuities are dispraportionately affected by asthma. </p>
<p> From 2012 to 2014, the six zip codes with the highest asthma hospitalization rates were all majority-black and in North City, whereas the three zip codes with the lowest asthma hospitalization rates were all majority-white and in South City. </p>
<h3> About Asthma </h3>
<p> Asthma is caused by enflamed airways in the lungs, which makes it difficult to breathe. 
<h3> Impacts of Asthma: </h3>
<p> can be managed with sufficient medical care </p> 
<p> but can be life-threatening for those who lack access to medical care (which is also disproportionately minority communities) </p>
<br>

## mold
<p> 70% of St. Louis wards that had 6 or more interior mold complaints in 2018 are majority black. </p>
<p> St. Louis is one of the worst major cities in the US for patients with sensitization (chronic non-allergic response) to mold. </p>
<p> The issue of mold is difficult to solve because it's expensive to remove and there aren't any standards that keep mold exposure from reaching a certain level, so many landlords refuse to address it. </p>
<p> Over 20% of St. Louis City's population live under the federal poverty level, which means that many lack the money and means to address mold exposure or to force their landlords to. </p>
<h3> Impacts of Mold Exposure: </h3>
<p> can cause/worsen: 
  <ul>
    <li> nasal and sinus congestion </li>
    <li> cough or sore throat </li>
    <li> chest tightness </li>
    <li> breathing difficulty </li>
    <li> upper respiratory tract infection </li>
    <li> headache </li>
    <li> skin and eye irritation </li>
   </ul>
<br> 
  
## air pollution 
<p> Air pollution in St. Louis comes from power plants, vehicles, and building demolitions, most of which are located in neighborhoods of color. St. Louis has violated the federal air standard for ozone since 1979, and the federal fine particle pollution standard from 2005 to 2017, subjecting many black neighborhoods to the harmful effects of air pollution. </p>
<p> Neighborhoods along the Missippi River, which have high percentages of people of color, are especially affected by this issue since there are many clusters of pollution sources in their area. </p> 
<p> In addition, many majority-black neighborhoods are near major highways, which means they are always exposed to air pollution from vehicles. </p>
<p> Finally, more demolition permits are issued in North City, where there are more black residents, than in other areas. These demolitions can cause extremely high levels of harmful dust, and can spread lead into the surrounding area if done poorly. </p>
<h3> Impacts of Air Pollution </h3>
<p> Can contribute to: 
  <ul>
    <li> Premature death </li>
    <li> Heart attacks </li>
    <li> Aggravated asthma </li>
    <li> Reduced lung function </li>
    <li> More frequent asthma attacks </li>
    <li> Worsened lung diseases </li>
    <li> Breathing difficulty </li>
    <li> Lung infections </li>
    <li> Lung damage </li>
    <li> Coughing or sore throat </li>
    <li> Cardiovascular diseases </li>
    <li> Adverse birth outcomes </li>
   </ul>
<br>

## home energy costs 
<p> Black households in St. Louis spend a significantly higher percent of their income on energy bills (7.5%) compared to the rest of the St. Louis population (4%). This issue is also present around the country: 50% of black families around the U.S. have difficulty paying energy bills. </p>
<p> This is because many black families live in poor quality housing, and poor quality housing comes with energy inefficiency due to poor insulation, air leaks, and inefficient heating and cooling systems. Landlords don't provide better appliances or improve quality because they have no financial incentive to do so. Because of energy innefficiency, many black and Latino families have to pay more per square foot. </p>
<p> Many programs, both national and state-level, have tried to help low-income households pay for utility bills, but they still aren't enough to help everyone in need. For example, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, only has enough funding to help 20-25% of eligable households. 
<h3> Impacts of High Energy Costs: </h3>
<p> Some households have to decrease budgets for basic necessities as well as heating and cooling. </p>
<br>

## food deserts 
<p> 11.9% of black St. Louis residents have limited access to healthy food compared to 6.3% for white residents. </p>
