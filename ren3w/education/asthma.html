    <p class="asthmaText"> From 2012 to 2014, the six zip codes with the highest asthma hospitalization rates were all majority-black and in North City, whereas the three zip codes with the lowest asthma hospitalization rates were all majority-white and in South City. </p>
    <p class="asthmaText"> Racial disparity when it comes to asthma is attributed to limited access to preventative healthcare, high mold exposure, high air pollution levels, and unsafe housing conditions. Such unsafe housing conditions, such as mold, can trigger asthma and are nearly impossible to detect before signing a lease. All these factors combined contribute to how black communities are dispraportionately affected by asthma.  </p>

  <h3 class="asthmaHeader"> About Asthma </h3>
    <p class="asthmaText"> Asthma is caused by enflamed airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

    <ul>
      <li class="asthmaText"> Managable with sufficient medical care </li>

    <h3 class="asthmaHeader"> Asthma Related Hospitalizations </h3>
    <p class="asthmaText"> Here is a map that shows the number of asthma related hospitalizations per 10,000 residents that occur in each ward. Again, majority-black neighborhoods have more asthma related hospitalizations than majority-white neighborhoods. </p>
