# ⚖ 🏫 title-ix-web-quest 🏑👟
 web quest i created for my web dev class on title ix. this webquest takes you through some basic information on what title ix is, gives some resources on more conclusive guides and information on title ix, and goes through the history of the law. the webquest also gives you a task to complete to help solidify your knowledge.

 (note: recently, title ix has come into question and challenge under besty devos. this web quest was created months before that event, so it does not include information on it. if you would like to learn more about current events and title ix, you can read <a href = "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/see-you-court-aclu-sues-betsy-devos-over-new-campus-n1206981">this article</a> from nbc, or check out this wonderful resource, <a href = "https://www.knowyourix.org/">know your ix</a>.)  

## disclaimer on header font used:
