            <h3> Background Information </h3> 
            <p> Title IX states that: </p>
            <p class = "differentrequirements"> &quot; No person in the United States shall, <span style = "color:  #D481C6"> on the basis of sex,</span> be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
                or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. &quot; </p> 
                <br> 
            <p> Title IX is most widely known for its implications relating to sports. Title IX has many other effects, but it does require that 
                equal athletic opportunities exists for males and females in schools that recieve federal funding. Title IX also requires 
                that those athletic opportunities be equally funded.   </p>

            <p> This is a video about the effects that Title IX had on sports and how the law was enforced. </p> 
            <br> 
            <p> Title IX is incredibly vague, which caused it to not take immediate affect. Many of the new processes required by Title IX did not 
                exist until activists demanded the protections that the law called for. The requirement of schools to take action under Title IX did 
                not exist until multiple college students who had been raped sued their universities for failing to take action, and the courts ruled in 
                the students favor.
