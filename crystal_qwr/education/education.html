      <H2><A href = "sex-ed.html" style = "color: black;">QUEER INCLUSIVE SEX-ED</A></H2> 
      <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;">queer people are ignored in sex education that is taught in schools and are often taught information that is mostly irrelavent to their lives. here we have compiled resources for a queer-inclusive sexual education. </P> 
      <H2><A HREF = "history.html"style = "color: black;">QUEER HISTORY </A></H2>
      <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> due to the stigma surrounding queer people, queer people and their contributions are often writtten completely out of history, or worse, their contributions are misattributed. here we have a queer history. </P>
      <H2><a href = "culture.html"style = "color: black;"> QUEER CULTURE </a></H2>
      <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> queer community is vital to feeling accepted and loved as someone society marginalized. find information on queer culture and how to find community near you. </P>
