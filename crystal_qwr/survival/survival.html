    <h2> <a href = "mental.html" style = "color:black;"> MENTAL HEALTH </a></h2>
    <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> mental health is key to one’s overall health, especially queer people’s. queer youth are at disproportionate risk for mental illness and suicidial ideation and attempts. we have resources to help with mental health. </P>
    <H2><a href = "physical.html" style = "color: black;"> PHYSICAL HEALTH</a> </H2>
    <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> due to queer bodies being ignored by medicine for centuries, navigating keeping physically healthy as a queer person can be difficult. we have resources to assist in finding queer centered healthcare, health insurance, and how to advocate for yourself as a queer person seeking healthcare. </P>
  <H2><a href = "food.html" style = "color:black;">FOOD</a>  </H2>
  <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> in addition to many other things, queer people are at disproportionate risk for food insecurity. find some resources to help here. </P>
  <H2><a href = "housing.html" style="color: black;"> HOUSING</a>  </H2>
  <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> due to the stigma surrounding being queer, queer people face much higher rates of housing insecurity. we have compiled resources to find affordable and emergency housing here. </P>
  <h2><a href = "bail.html" style="color: black;"> BAIL </a></h2>
  <p style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> queer people are three times more likely to be jailed and many can't afford bail. bail funds help get queer people out of jail through crowdsourcing. </p> 
  <H2><a href = "education.html" style = "color: black;"> EDUCATION</a>  </H2>
  <p style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> society values education. depending on what you need or would like to do with your life, you may require a formal education. if you need help graduating high school or pursuing higher education, we have compiled some resources here. </p>
