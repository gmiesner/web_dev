  <h2><a href = "about.html" style = "color:black;"> WHAT IS CRYSTAL QWR? </a></h2>
   <p style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> we are a resource compiling queer resources to remove barriers for queer youth. we currently have national resources and resources for saint louis, missouri, kansas city, and chicago, illinois, but plan to expand the website to include local resources across the us. </p>

<h2><a href = "survival/survival.html" style = "color:black;"> SURVIVAL</a> </h2>
  <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> access to certain resources can be life or death for queer youth. we provide a resource to find queer centered healthcare, housing, food, mental health services, and access to formal education for those who wish to pursue it. </P>
  <h2 ><a href = "education/education.html" style = "color:black;"> EDUCATION </a></h2>
  <p style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> education is critical, especially to queer youth, who have often not been given relavent sex education, mental health education, or been educated at all on the history of their community. we provide resources to become educated on all of these things and more. </p>
  <h2><a href = "advocacy/advocacy.html" style = "color:black;"> ADVOCACY </a></h2>
  <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> as queer people, we must learn to advocate for ourselves and our peers. we will provide resources on how to become a better advocate for yourself and others, as well as local and national opportunities in advocacy. </P>
  <h2><a href = "" style = "color:black;"> NEAR ME </a></h2>
  <P style = "margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;"> this directory helps you find queer resources near you. </P>
